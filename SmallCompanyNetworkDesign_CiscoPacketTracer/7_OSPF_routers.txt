!OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First. Itâ€™s a widely used dynamic routing protocol for IP networks.
!Automatically discovers other routers in the network running OSPF.
!Uses a link-state algorithm to calculate the shortest and most efficient path to each network.
!Helps routers make smart forwarding decisions so packets take the best route.
!supports vlsm variable length subnet masking and cidr


router ospf 10
! Start OSPF process with process ID 10

router-id 1.1.1.1
! Assign a fixed OSPF router ID (helps OSPF identify this router uniquely)

network 195.136.17.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
! Advertise the subnet 195.136.17.0/30 into OSPF area 0 - tells ospf to enable on interfaces in these ip ranges, advertising those subnets into ospf area 0

network 195.136.17.20 0.0.0.3 area 0
! Advertise the subnet 195.136.17.20/30 into OSPF area 0 - wildcard mask 0.0.0.3 corresponds to a subnet mask of /30 - 255.255.255.252

network 195.136.17.36 0.0.0.3 area 0
! Advertise the subnet 195.136.17.36/30 into OSPF area 0

do write
! Save the running configuration to startup-config


! in exec, run 'show ip ospf' to see the ospf config.
! to erase those configs, 'clear ip ospf process'
